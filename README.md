# FE7 Skill System 

The aim is to provide a working skill system for fans that prefer FE7 over FE8 (we are a dying breed).

With the exception of one or two, all skills have been created from scratch.

Skills can now have their target unit changed ust by editing the name defined in the corresponding event file without needing to recompile any ASM (instructions below). However, only one character/unit can have a skill at a time with the new method (still working on this).

### Target features

- âœ“ Document each skill so their workings can be easily understood
- Outline a graphical space in the stat screen for skills to be shown per unit
- Investigate an alternative to skills that hook at the same address space

### How to Use

- Locate the `.event` file of the skill you wish to use
- Go to `Event_Assembler\EA Standard Library\FE7 Definitions.txt` to get the list of units to apply skills to
- They will look like this `#define Eliwood 0x01` (you just want the name)
- In the `.event file` for your skill e.g `LifeAndDeath.event` add `WORD` + the name of the unit you grabbed under the `#incbin` line
- Now uncomment one of the `#include` lines within Buildfile.event (BanditBreaker and the effectiveness table must be paired)
- Put your base rom in the same folder as the build file and rename it to FE7_clean.gba
- Drag that GBA file onto the 'MAKE HACK' file which will produce a new GBA file called `FE_Hack.gba` with the skill applied
- Now when you load that GBA file the skill should work.

### Things to consider

- While a skill can technically be applied to multiple units, right now you'll have to add those additional checks yourself
- This project uses the freespace range `#0x8D00000 - #0x8E00000` so make sure it's not conflicting with any other hacks you're using
- Some skills (like the breakers) hook into the same space, so will conflict with each other if you use multiple (currently looking into solution)
