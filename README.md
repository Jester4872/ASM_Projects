# FE7 Skill System 

The aim is to provide a working skill system for fans that prefer FE7 over FE8 (we are a dying breed).

With the exception of one or two, all skills have been created from scratch.

Currently, skills must be assigned by defining either a weapon ID or class/character ID that the skill will activate on. As you can imagine, this involves going into each skill and manually setting the required ASM (though I have made an effort to document what every line does).

### Target features

- âœ“ Document each skill so their workings can be easily understood
- Outline a graphical space in the stat screen for skills to be shown per unit
- Investigate an alternative to skills that hook at the same address space

### How to Use

- Locate the ASM file of the skill you want to apply
- Change the ID of the unit you want to apply it to (most are set to #0x3 which is Lyn)
- Drag that ASM file onto the AssembleARM.bat file to recompile a new DMP file
- Uncomment one of the `#include` lines within Buildfile.event (BanditBreaker and the effectiveness table must be paired)
- Put your base rom in the same folder as the build file and rename it to FE7_clean.gba
- Drag that GBA file onto the 'MAKE HACK' file which will produce a new GBA file called `FE_Hack.gba` with the skill applied
- Now when you load that GBA file the skill should work.

### Things to consider

- While a skill can technically be applied to multiple units, right now you'll have to add those additional checks yourself
- This project uses the freespace range `#0x8D00000 - #0x8E00000` so make sure it's not conflicting with any other hacks you're using
- Some skills (like the breakers) hook into the same space, so will conflict with each other if you use multiple (currently looking into solution)
