CHARACTER AND BATTLE STRUCT:

Each character has a 0x48-byte struct in RAM that stores things like status, location, stats, etc, beginning at 202AB78 (FE6), 202BD50 (FE7), or 202BE4C (FE8).
The battle structs (which is more of an 'interaction struct', since it gets called for non-battle stuff as well) are 0x80 bytes long, of which the first 0x48 are essentially the same as the character structs. There are two of these, one for the attacker/instigator at 203A3F0 (FE7)/203A4EC (FE8) and one for the defender/target at 203A470 (FE7)/203A56C (FE8).
FE6-Attacker at 2039214 and defender is at 2039290; each one is 0x7C bytes long because weapon abilities are a halfword and there's no lethality

Character struct:
Byte	Type	Description
0x00	Word	Pointer to character data
0x04	Word	Pointer to class data
0x08	Byte	Level
0x09	Byte	Experience
0x0A	Byte	Seems to be used for AI decisions since the value here depends on weapon type/range/other things (3C120 deals with this?)
	0x01		Has magic weapon (also seems to be used for 'is in recovery mode' depending on phase)
	0x02		Has staff
	0x04		Has item with staff/use effect (byte 0x1E in item data) as 1-5 (healing staff) or 0x21-0x22 (vulnerary/elixir)
	0x08		Has item 0x51 (silence)
	0x10		Has item 0x52 (sleep)
	0x20		Has item 0x53 (berserk)
	0x40		Has weapon with more than 1 range
	0x80		?
0x0B	Byte	Deployment byte; top two bits are used for allegiance (0x00 for player, 0x40 for NPC, 0x80 for enemy) and to retrieve character data using the unit map (see Map section)
0x0C	Word	Unit state bitfield, as follows: NOTE: FE6 ONLY HAS 2 BYTES FOR THIS
	Byte 0xC
	0x01		Selected/not drawn
	0x02		Unselectable
	0x04		Dead (used in conjunction with 0x1 to not display)
	0x08		Not deployed
	0x10		Rescuing someone
	0x20		Being rescued
	0x40		Moved this turn/canto-ing
	0x80		On a roof tile (basically, a do-not-display). Checked at 79FFC. Also skips displaying danger zone at 1B894.
	
	Byte 0xD
	0x01		Makes the movement squares appear over the standing map sprites, but the function at 1895C clears this from all units every time a unit is selected. Checked at 27260. May be related to bit 0x2, since if that's set outside the link arena, if you select and deselect a unit, 0x2 is cleared and 0x1 is set.
	0x02		In the link arena, doesn't display map sprite if you set 'Hide Units' to On (and presumably calls function to display that weird arrow thing instead)
	0x04		Gets cleared when being danced, but no idea what it does (set at 39B92, cleared at 18836) (doesn't seem to be read; maybe part of a special AI)(definitely AI related)
	0x08		Inside ballista
	0x10		Drop last item
	0x20		Afa's drops/Metis tome
	0x40		Solo Animation 1
	0x80		Solo Animation 2
	
	Byte 0xE
	0x01		Unit is REMU'd and not drawn. Checked at 34298, amongst others (fe7 18916: if set, sets byte 4, 0x4)
	0x02		After battle, store turn word from battle struct to char data, then store these 3 bits at 3003060 (2C20A), but doesn't seem to be used there
	0x04		^ (also written at 2CE60 and 317AA) (not used here either)
	0x08		^ However, B5998 checks if 0x08 and either 0x04 or 0x02 are set; if true, it actives a super-arena mode (different conversation and higher-level enemies). They still don't seem to get set, however, and the alternate text is glitchy.
	0x20		Not deployed in previous chapter
	0x40		Cutscene unit, will be deleted when units are cleared (with CLEA) or a prep screen is reached
	0x80		Increase portrait index by 1
	
	Byte 0xF
	0x01		Makes the standing map sprite shake very quickly (checked at 27270)
	0x02		Unit cannot take part in chapter (at least, in fe7). Checked at 34298 and 1239E
	0x04		Unit is REMU'd
	0x08		Link arena palette (checked at 27146) (may be for a general "alternate map palette" thing, since it's also used for Ephidel and the dragon disintegrating in FE7 Ch19/Ch20)
	0x40		Unused as far as I know; used by me for Capture

0x1B	Byte	If rescuing, allegiance byte of unit being rescued; if being rescued, allegiance byte of rescuer
0x1C	Byte	Index of ballista trap data (if riding)

0x22	Short	Third item and uses
0x24	Short	Fourth item and uses

0x39	Byte	Bitfield; each bit is a support partner (in the order they appear in) and is set if a support has been obtained in that chapter
0x3A	Byte	??
0x3B	Byte	?? (nintenlord's doc says Leader, but I'm not sure if that's true, since leader appears to be 0x38)
0x3C	Word	Pointer to map sprite data in RAM
0x40	Byte	AI 3 byte
0x41	Byte	AI 4 byte

0x4C	Word	Equipped item's weapon ability word (+0x8 in item struct) (only a halfword in FE6, so everything after this will be off by 2)
0x50	Byte	Weapon type; writes appropriate magic type if using a magic sword (hardcoded to item id, function at 2A882 (FE8)
0x51	Byte	Inventory slot of equipped weapon? (8 for in ballista) (should always be 0 for battle since equipped item moves to the top of the list?)
0x52	Byte	Bool?; read when calculating weapon xp apparently (seems to be "can counter")
0x53	Byte	Weapon triangle hit effect
0x54	Byte	Weapon triangle damage effect
0x55	Byte	Terrain tile ID

0x7B	Byte	Multipler for weapon exp
0x7C	Byte	Bool; true if damage is non-zero (used in exp calculations) 
0x7D	Byte	Bool; true if weapon broke
0x7E	Byte	??; 1D1E6 and 322C4 set this to 0, but it doesn't seem to be read
0x7F	Byte	?? (seems to be unused)

Just before the attacker's battle struct is data used to display the pre-battle numbers and calculate the rounds data
203A4D4 (FE8) 203A4D0 (FE8J) 203A3D8 (FE7)
0x00	Short	Seems to be a bitfield (0x2 seems to be 'battle hasn't started yet') (0x20 is arena) (0x80 is staff?) (0x40 = dance) (0x200 = dancer ring)
Byte 0x0:
	0x01 Battle has started
	0x02 Battle not started yet
	0x04 ?
	0x08 Ballista

0x08	Short	Defense
0x0A	Short	Battle hit
0x0C	Short	Battle crit
0x0E	Short	Lethality chance

After the defender's battle struct is the rounds data. Each round is a word, and there's room for 7 rounds (presumably, for arena battles and the like, the buffer is cleared and recalculated after 7 rounds)
